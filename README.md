# MusicDownloader
Downloads music from youtube based off an imported csv file. Creates a file directory structure Band > Album > Song based on the specified output directory.
Songs are then converted to MP3s to add meta-data and to normalize the audio. The normalization process forces all songs to play at the same level audio so that some songs aren't louder than others.
